Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

TODO

I have created a wave file in my code, one to RB and the other to WB; however, the code should run and allow me to record my voice and output a waveform of what i said. In addition, what else I have done is the figsize, making the width and height of it big enough to input the increasing amplitude of the sound wave. 
#### What have you not done for your project yet?

TODO

Well, i think i have done everything, But I am currently Debugging.
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have encountered reading and writing on a wave file and currently having problems with the file not found directory.
